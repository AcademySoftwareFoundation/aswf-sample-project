## Outstanding Security Issues

_A list of current, unaddressed security issues, with an assessment of severity and a timeframe for resolution. Publicly disclosed [CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org/) should be listed here._

## Addressed Security Issues

_A historical list of addressed security vulnerabilities, in particular any public CVEs, with corresponding release information._

## File Format Expectations

_Assuming [COMMUNITY NAME] defines a data file format, a discussion of what a user should expect happens when operating on a valid or invalid [COMMUNITY NAME] data file._
