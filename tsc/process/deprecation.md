# Deprecation Strategy for PROJECT

This should discuss the following topics:

- How many major versions of PROJECT are supported
- How this interact with versions of the [VFX Reference Platform](http://www.vfxplatform.com/)
- How this interact with versions of commercial DCC applications that use PROJECT
- How far back does API or ABI compatibility extend
- There should be an explicit policy on fixing severe security issues in versions that are no longer supported.
- Any other relevant information useful to PROJECT users when making decision about the lifecycle of the project.
